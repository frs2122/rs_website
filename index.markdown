## About   

Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a Research Associate in the [Economics Division at Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/economics). I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Business-Economics with Honors from UCLA. 

My primary research interests are economic history, political economy of development, and labor economics. I plan to combine these interests to study the long-lasting effects of U.S. colonization through an economics lens.

I was born in San Diego, California, and grew up in Japan, Guam, San Diego, and Singapore.
